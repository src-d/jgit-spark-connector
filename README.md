# engine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/src-d/engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/src-d/engine) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/src-d/engine/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/src-d/engine) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/tech.sourced/engine/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/tech.sourced/engine)

**engine** is a library for running scalable data retrieval pipelines that process any number of Git repositories for source code analysis.

It is written in Scala and built on top of Apache Spark to enable rapid construction of custom analysis pipelines and processing large number of Git repositories stored in HDFS in [Siva file format](https://github.com/src-d/go-siva). It is accessible both via Scala and Python Spark APIs, and capable of running on large-scale distributed clusters.

Current implementation combines:
 - [src-d/enry](https://github.com/src-d/enry) to detect programming language of every file
 - [bblfsh/client-scala](https://github.com/bblfsh/client-scala) to parse every file to UAST
 - [src-d/siva-java](https://github.com/src-d/siva-java) for reading Siva files in JVM
 - [apache/spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) to extend DataFrame API
 - [eclipse/jgit](https://github.com/eclipse/jgit) for working with Git .pack files


# Quick-start

First, you need to download [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) somewhere on your machine:

```bash
$ cd /tmp && wget "https://www.apache.org/dyn/mirrors/mirrors.cgi?action=download&filename=spark/spark-2.2.0/spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz" -O spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
```
The Apache Software Foundation suggests you the better mirror where you can download `Spark` from. If you wish to take a look and find the best option in your case, you can [do it here](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/spark/spark-2.2.0/spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz).

Then you must extract `Spark` from the downloaded tar file:

```bash
$ tar -C ~/ -xvzf spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
```

Binaries and scripts to run `Spark` are located in spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7/bin, so should set `PATH` and `SPARK_HOME` to point to this directory. It's advised to add this to your shell profile:

```bash
$ export SPARK_HOME=$HOME/spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7
$ export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
```

Look for the latest [**engine** version](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.sourced), and then replace in the command where `[version]` is showed:

```bash
$ spark-shell --packages "tech.sourced:engine:[version]"

# or

$ pyspark --packages "tech.sourced:engine:[version]"
```

Run [bblfsh daemon](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd). You can start it easily in a container following its [quick start guide](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd#quick-start).


# Pre-requisites

* Scala 2.11.x
* [Apache Spark Installation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) >= 2.2.0
* [bblfsh](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd): Used for UAST extraction

# Examples of engine usage

**engine** is available on [maven central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.sourced.engine). To add it to your project as a dependency,

For projects managed by [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tech.sourced</groupId>
    <artifactId>engine</artifactId>
    <version>[version]</version>
</dependency>
```

For [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) managed projects add the dependency:

    libraryDependencies += "tech.sourced" % "engine" % "[version]"

In both cases, replace `[version]` with the [latest engine version](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.sourced)

### Usage in applications as a dependency

The default jar published is a fatjar containing all the dependencies required by the engine. It's meant to be used directly as a jar or through `--packages` for Spark usage.

If you want to use it in an application and built a fatjar with that you need to follow these steps to use what we call the "slim" jar:

With maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tech.sourced</groupId>
    <artifactId>engine</artifactId>
    <version>[version]</version>
    <classifier>slim</classifier>
</dependency>
```

Or (for sbt):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "tech.sourced" % "engine" % "[version]" % Compile classifier "slim"
```

If you run into problems with `io.netty.versions.properties` on sbt, you can add the following snippet to solve it:

In sbt:

```scala
assemblyMergeStrategy in assembly := {
  case "META-INF/io.netty.versions.properties" => MergeStrategy.last
  case x =>
    val oldStrategy = (assemblyMergeStrategy in assembly).value
    oldStrategy(x)
}
```

## pyspark

### Local mode

Install python-wrappers is necessary to use **engine** from pyspark:

``` bash
$ pip install sourced-engine
```

Then you should provide the **engine's** maven coordinates to the pyspark's shell:
```bash
$ $SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages "tech.sourced:engine:[version]"
```
Replace `[version]` with the [latest engine version](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.sourced)

### Cluster mode

Install **engine** wrappers as in local mode:
```bash
$ pip install -e sourced-engine
```

Then you should package and compress with `zip`  the python wrappers to provide pyspark with it. It's required to distribute the code among the nodes of the cluster.

```bash
$ zip <path-to-installed-package> ./sourced-engine.zip
$ $SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark <same-args-as-local-plus> --py-files ./sourced-engine.zip
```

### pyspark API usage

Run pyspark as explained before to start using the engine, replacing `[version]` with the [latest engine version](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.sourced):

```bash
$ $SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages "tech.sourced:engine:[version]"
Welcome to

   spark version 2.2.0

Using Python version 3.6.2 (default, Jul 20 2017 03:52:27)
SparkSession available as 'spark'.
>>> from sourced.engine import Engine
>>> engine = Engine(spark, '/path/to/siva/files')
>>> engine.repositories.filter('id = "github.com/mingrammer/funmath.git"').references.filter("name = 'refs/heads/HEAD'").show()
+--------------------+---------------+--------------------+
|       repository_id|           name|                hash|
+--------------------+---------------+--------------------+
|github.com/mingra...|refs/heads/HEAD|290440b64a73f5c7e...|
+--------------------+---------------+--------------------+

```

## Scala API usage

You must provide **engine** as a dependency in the following way, replacing `[version]` with the [latest engine version](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.sourced):

```bash
$ spark-shell --packages "tech.sourced:engine:[version]"
```

To start using **engine** from the shell you must import everything inside the `tech.sourced.engine` package (or, if you prefer, just import `Engine` and `EngineDataFrame` classes):

```bash
scala> import tech.sourced.engine._
import tech.sourced.engine._
```

Now, you need to create an instance of `Engine` and give it the spark session and the path of the directory containing the siva files:

```bash
scala> val engine = Engine(spark, "/path/to/siva-files")
```

Then, you will be able to perform queries over the repositories:

```bash
scala> engine.getRepositories.filter('id === "github.com/mawag/faq-xiyoulinux"').
     | getReferences.filter('name === "refs/heads/HEAD"').
     | getCommits.filter('message.contains("Initial")').
     | select('repository_id', 'hash', 'message').
     | show

     +--------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------+
     |                 repository_id|                                hash|          message|
     +--------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------+
     |github.com/mawag/...|fff7062de8474d10a...|Initial commit|
     +--------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------+

```

# Playing around with **engine** on Jupyter

You can launch our docker container which contains some Notebooks examples just running:

    docker run --name engine-jupyter --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/path/to/siva-files:/repositories --link bblfshd:bblfshd srcd/engine-jupyter

You must have some siva files in local to mount them on the container replacing the path `$(pwd)/path/to/siva-files`. You can get some siva-files from the project [here](https://github.com/src-d/engine/tree/master/examples/siva-files).

You should have a [bblfsh daemon](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd) container running to link the jupyter container (see Pre-requisites).

When the `engine-jupyter` container starts it will show you an URL that you can open in your browser.

# Using engine directly from Python

If you are using engine directly from Python and are unable to modify the `PYTHON_SUBMIT_ARGS` you can copy the engine jar to the pyspark jars to make it available there.

```
cp engine.jar "$(python -c 'import pyspark; print(pyspark.__path__[0])'/jars"
```

This way, you can use it in the following way:

```python
import sys

pyspark_path = "/path/to/pyspark/python"
sys.path.append(pyspark_path)

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from sourced.engine import Engine

siva_folder = "/path/to/siva-files"
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("test").master("local[*]").getOrCreate()
engine = Engine(spark, siva_folder)
```

# Development

## Build fatjar

Build the fatjar is needed to build the docker image that contains the jupyter server,  or test changes in spark-shell just passing the jar with `--jars` flag:

```bash
$ make build
```

It leaves the fatjar in `target/scala-2.11/engine-uber.jar`

## Build and run docker to get a Jupyter server

To build an image with the last built of the project:

```bash
$ make docker-build
```

Notebooks under examples folder will be included on the image.

To run a container with the Jupyter server:

```bash
$ make docker-run
```

Before run the jupyter container you must run a [bblfsh daemon](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd):

```bash
$ make docker-bblfsh
```

If it's the first time you run the [bblfsh daemon](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd), you must install the drivers:

```bash
$ make docker-bblfsh-install-drivers
```

To see installed drivers:

```bash
$ make docker-bblfsh-list-drivers
```

To remove the development jupyter image generated:

```bash
$ make docker-clean
```

## Run tests

**engine** uses [bblfsh](https://github.com/bblfsh) so you need an instance of a bblfsh server running:

```bash
$ make docker-bblfsh
```

To run tests:
```bash
$ make test
```

To run tests for python wrapper:

```bash
$ cd python
$ make test
```

### Windows support

There is no windows support in enry-java or bblfsh's client-scala right now, so all the language detection and UAST features are not available for the windows platform.
